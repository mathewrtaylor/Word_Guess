# Word_Guess

## Word Guessing Game
This is a simple word guessing game program written in Python.

## How to Play
When you run the program, it will randomly select a word and display it to you as a series of underscores representing each letter.

You will then be prompted to guess a letter. If the letter is in the word, it will reveal its correct position. If not, you lose a turn.

You have a limited number of turns to try and guess all the letters before you run out of turns and lose.

The game ends when you either guess the full word correctly before running out of turns, or you use up all your turns.

At the end, it will display whether you won or lost, and reveal the full word.

## Requirements
Python 3.x

## Usage
To play the game:

`python word_guess.py`
